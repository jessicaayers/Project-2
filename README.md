# Project-2

## Purpose:

The purpose of this repo is to explore different types of models predicting the number of shares from the Online News Popularity data. Six different files are created. Each one is unique to the type of data channel. Summary plots are created along with the creation of two different linear models, a boosted tree model, and a random forest model. At the end of the analysis, the model with the smallest RMSE (root mean squared error) is chosen to be the best fitting model.
